# TSL1: A Peer-to-Peer Token Protocol for Bitcoin (draft v0.1)

A purely peer-to-peer token protocol on bitcoin would allow for the creation of novel tokenisation use-cases. The main benefits of such a token protocol would be lost if a trusted third-party is still required to provide double-spend protection of the tokens. I propose a solution to the double-spend problem for non-native tokens which benefit from the same double-spend protections as bitcoinâ€™s native accounting units. Wallets establish direct connections to one another by participating in a peer-to-peer overlay network separate from that of the bitcoin nodes. Tokens are transmitted in an [SPV manner](cite)(Simplified Payment Verification) between wallet peers. Wallets are recommended to simultaneously act as both headers-only SPV nodes within the bitcoin P2P network, and full peering nodes within a P2P overlay network. The P2P overlay network will facilitate direct wallet-to-wallet communications, and the bitcoin network will provide settlement and finality of the token transfers.
